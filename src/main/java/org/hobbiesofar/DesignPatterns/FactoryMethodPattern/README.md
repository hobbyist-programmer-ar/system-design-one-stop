# Factory Method pattern
It is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.
 The Factory pattern suggests that you replace direct object cconstruction calls(with a new operator) with calls to  a special factory. The new operator is just called with this factory method.
